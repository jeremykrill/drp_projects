In Spring 2021, my project was a dive into the theory behind Lie groups and Lie algebras. I was mentored by Will Stewart. The corresponding book I worked through was Representation Theory by Joe Fulton & William Harris, found [here](https://mat.uab.cat/~pitsch/ReadingSeminar/Fulton-Harris.pdf). The twelve-minute talk can be found on UT's DRP [website](https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/drp/projects.html).
