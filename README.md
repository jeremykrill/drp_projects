# drp_projects
Projects I've worked on for the math department's Directed Reading Program. At the end of each semester, students give a talk on an aspect of their work they found particularly interesting.
In fall 2020, I did a project on the representation theory of SU(2) and its usefulness in quantum mechanics. I primarily read through Peter Woit's Quantum Theory, Groups, and Representations, which you can find an online version of here: https://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/QM/fall-course.pdf.
