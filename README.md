Projects I've worked on for the math department's Directed Reading Program. At the end of each semester, students give a talk on an aspect of their work they found particularly interesting.

In Fall 2020, I did a project on the representation theory of SU(2) and its usefulness in quantum mechanics, mentored by Rok Gregoric. I primarily read through Peter Woit's Quantum Theory, Groups, and Representations, which you can find an online version of [here](https://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/QM/fall-course.pdf).

In Spring 2021, my project was a dive into the theory behind Lie groups and Lie algebras. I was mentored by Will Stewart. The corresponding book I worked through was Representation Theory by Joe Fulton & William Harris, found [here](https://mat.uab.cat/~pitsch/ReadingSeminar/Fulton-Harris.pdf).
