In Fall 2020, I did a project on the representation theory of SU(2) and its usefulness in quantum mechanics, mentored by Rok Gregoric. I primarily read through Peter Woit's Quantum Theory, Groups, and Representations, which you can find an online version of [here](https://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/QM/fall-course.pdf). Although there was no symposium this semester, I created a presentation I would have used in a longer talk.
